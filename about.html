    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a Computer Science student with an interest in information systems and problem-solving. Through my studies, particularly in the Principles of Information Systems course, I have developed foundational knowledge in system analysis and teamwork. During the course, I completed two team-based projects that strengthened my collaboration, communication, and ability to work effectively toward shared goals. I also volunteered at the ICPC 2025 World Finals, where I gained experience working in a professional and international environment while developing organizational and teamwork skills. In addition to my academic work, I am interested in programming and learning new technologies, which motivates me to continuously improve my technical and analytical skills.</p>

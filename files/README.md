Place your volunteer certificate PDF here and name it exactly `Volunteer_Certificate.pdf`.

Steps:
1. Copy your PDF to this folder: `files/Volunteer_Certificate.pdf`.
2. In your terminal (inside the project folder) run:

   git add files/Volunteer_Certificate.pdf
   git add about.html
   git commit -m "Add volunteering certificate and link"
   git push

After pushing, wait ~1 minute and refresh your site. The link on `about.html` will download the PDF.

If your PDF has a different name, either rename it to `Volunteer_Certificate.pdf` or update the link in `about.html` accordingly.
